Introduction

<br>Hello there! <br><br> I'm Grace Brunina, and I have been writing help content for the past 12 years. I would love to show you what I've learned during that time! 
<br> <br> I have created dozens of user guides and one-pagers, thousands of articles, and hundreds of walkthroughs. I developed a methodology that has deflected
support cases up to 96%. 
<br> <br> If you want to learn how to optimize your help center with steps a middle schooler could follow, or write simple and intuitive UX, I'm here and happy to help.
