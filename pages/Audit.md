<h1>Auditing Content</h1>
To perform an audit, first break up your support center into "like" items:
<ol>Articles</ol>
<ol>Guides</ol>
<ol>Videos</ol>
<br>Once separated, if available, look at the metrics to see where you'll make the biggest impact
- What type of content is accessed the most? What generates the most questions? 
<br><br> Create a spreadsheet to categorize the content into like items, that need attention first. If there is not a lot, or no traffic to certain pieces of
content, and it doesn't solve a major problem - delete it. 
<h2>Check for Usefulness</h2>
<br>If you are gathering feedback for your content, you'll want to check it to make a decision if it's worth taking the time to edit, or if it should be deleted.
Content that has high views and are rated positively are considered "Useful." For content 
with high views, rated negatively make a choice to:
<ol>Salvage - Make edits using the feedback</ol>
<ol>Delete - No longer relevant, duplicate, doesn't solve major problems</ol>
<h2>Check for Accuracy</h2>
<br>Now that you have a list of content to edit, you will want to check the following to ensure it's up to date:
<ol>screenshots/gifs</ol>
<ol>instructions</ol>
<ol>terminology</ol>
<br><br>If the product is going to be seeing major UX changes in the future, but the instructions and terminology will remain the same, I recommend deleting the 
screenshots/gifs, make sure that the content is descriptive enough to not require a screenshot/gif and make a note in your spreadsheet to come back to it. 
<h2>Gap Analysis</h2>
Once you've combed through and edited your existing content, you'll want to fill in the gaps. There are a few ways to do this:
<ol>Ask customer facing roles like support/sales/implementation what questions they frequently recieve</ol>
<ol>Check searches without results</ol>
<H2>Categorization</H2>
Updated content is worthless if it's not easy to find. To finish the audit, you'll want to make sure that your help center has the following elements:
<ol>FAQ section - Include the answers to your customers most common issues here</ol>
<ol>Getting Started - Include the first steps every persona needs to take in order to be successful</ol>
<ol>High Level Categories - This could be personas, or high level experiences that customers navigate through when using your software/product</ol>
<ol>Sub Categories - If your high-level experiences can be broken into further categories, house them within a sub-catgory</ol>
<br><br> For example, if your software is used by Admins and End-Users, you'd want to create them as the high-level category, with "Account," "Registration," "Financials," etc, as your sub categories.
