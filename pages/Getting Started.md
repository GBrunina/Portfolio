<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<br><br> Usually, getting started involves selecting a person who will be auditing the help center, updating the content, and maintaining it so it does not get stale.
<br><br>I recommend promoting this person from a customer-facing role as they know your audience and product the best. 
<br><br>This person needs to have the following skills, at a minimum:
<ol>Writing - They need to be able to condense technical topics into easy-to-follow steps</ol>
<ol>Research and Exploration - To fully understand the topic they're writing about to easily convey it to others</ol>
<ol>Proofreading - If this person is going to be the sole writer, they need to be able to edit their own content</ol>
<ol>Systemic - To optimize the structure of documentation to make help easily attainable for users</ol>
<ol>Team Player - Need to be able to work as a team with all departments to ensure there's adequate communication and cooperation</ol>
<br><br> Once this person is hired, they need to position themselves in the middle of all current projects, so they can be proactive. If they know that there will
be a major update to Profiles - they'll be able to "skip" that section when auditing in favor of topics that will not be undergoing a major change.
