<h1>Introduction</h1>
<br><br> 
In the summer of 2011, I became a Tier 1 Support Representative as the 20th hire at a small software company. 
It became apparent right away that I was stuck answering the same questions again and again. We had 50-page guides that would answer all of the user's questions (and more)
but they weren't reading them. There needed to be a change, and I made it my mission (and career). 
<br><br>
I began testing documentation styles until I found one that worked all of the time. I learned that I didn't need to share so much information - my audience wanted to complete
a specific task in a limited amount of time. They didn't want to know the thought process as to why you would be taking this action - they knew they needed to take it, they
just didn't know where to start.
<br><br>
From then on, I was promoted to "Technical Writer" and dedicated my career to reducing contacts to support - not only for the support team, but for our customers as well.
Since the first audit and revamp, I have successfully used the method that I will be sharing with you to evaluate dozens of support centers, which now act as Tier 1 Support.
