## About Me

_Hi! I'm so happy you're here._
I am a Content Manager with 12 years of experience, looking to transition to a UX Writer role to reduce the need for technical documentation by creating intuitive experiences in-app.

I am currently managing 7 help centers with an average support deflection rate of 76%. I love to help optimize help centers and teach writers how to turn complexity into steps a 7th grader could follow.

If you were to ask people about me, they would probably say "She's the knower of all things," and "She can transform a blog post into a tweet without losing any context."

I love to turn chaos into order and spin hay into gold with language.
